In this project I have used to stereovision( using 2 or more cameras to produce 3d image ) to identify obejects in front of the car during its motion on road. 
The objects are then identified using a pre-feeded algorithm and then its decided how crucial is it to avoid the object and respectively motions of car is programmed to avoid crashing into the object.
The engine of the car is controlled using arduino and thereafter the code is run to produce respective motion for the car.
